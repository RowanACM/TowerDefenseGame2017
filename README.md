# TowerDefenseGame2017
This is the new repository for our Tower Defense Game, which fixes some problems with the old repository such as it only existing in the assets folder of a unity project. This repository will contain the full Unity Project

The old repository of 2016 work is located in our RowanACM/TowerDefenseGame repository

This repository will evolve into a fully open-source tower defense game created entirely by our Animation and Game Design Team members.
